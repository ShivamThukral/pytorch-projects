# Pytorch Projects
This repository the following projects:
- [MNIST Playbook](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/Pytorch_Playbook.ipynb) : We train a network that is build from scatch in pytorch and use tensorboard toolkit to visualise the results. In the end, I also show how we perform FGSM attack (adversial example) on this trained model.
- [STN](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/Spatial_Transform_Networks.ipynb) : Spatial Transformer Networks allow a neural network to learn how to perform spatial transformations on the input image in order to enhance the geometric invariance of the model.
- [LeNet](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/LeNet5.ipynb) : Implementation of LeNet network on MNIST dataset.
- (In progress) [AlexNet](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/AlexNet.ipynb) : Implementation of AlexNet architecture, that won ImageNet challenge in 2012. In this notebook we have used Tensorboard with visualisations and CIFAR10 as the training dataset.
- (TODO) VGG: Implementation of 2014 ImageNet Challenge winner. In this notebook, we look at the concept of transfer learning. 
- (TODO) ResNet :

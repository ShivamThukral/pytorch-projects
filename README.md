# Vision Projects using PyTorch
This repository has PyTorch tutorials on:
## Image Classification
- [MNIST Playbook](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/classification/00-MNIST_Playbook.ipynb) : We train a network that is build from scratch in PyTorch and use tensorboard toolkit to visualise the results. In the end, I also show how we perform FGSM attack (adversial example) on this trained model.
- [STN](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/classification/01-Spatial_Transform_Networks.ipynb) : Spatial Transformer Networks allow a neural network to learn how to perform spatial transformations on the input image in order to enhance the geometric invariance of the model.
- [LeNet](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/classification/02-LeNet5.ipynb) : Implementation of LeNet network on MNIST dataset.
- [AlexNet](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/classification/03-AlexNet.ipynb) : Implementation of AlexNet architecture, that won ImageNet challenge in 2012. In this notebook we have used Tensorboard for visualizations and CIFAR10 as the training dataset.
- [VGG16](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/classification/04-Transfer_Learning_with_VGG16.ipynb): Implementation of 2014 ImageNet Challenge winner. In this notebook, we look at the concept of transfer learning.

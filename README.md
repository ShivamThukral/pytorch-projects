# Pytorch Projects
This repository the following projects:
- [MNIST Playbook](https://github.com/ShivamThukral/pytorch-projects/blob/devel/Pytorch_Playbook.ipynb) : We train a network that is build from scatch in pytorch and use tensorboard toolkit to visualise the results. In the end, I also show how we perform FGSM attack (adversial example) on this trained model.
